this was specifically made for a server of mine
Also to learn how to make bot s!!!
## features
### message logger 
whenever a message is sent it appends the message into a text file named after the channel it was sent in

### meme sender
 picks a random file from a user specified directory and sends it in chat
 if you use /send_meme you can choose what file type you want and optionally choose the exact file
 if you specify a channel id in config.͏py then the bot will send a random meme every 30 minutes

###  calculator
the calculator does not work due to rounding errors

### coinflip
This was extremely hard to implement. 

### christtt referencer
if you mention the name of a piece of [christtt's discography](https://christtt.bandcamp.com/) then there will be a 1/6 chance the bot will shout you out for it
