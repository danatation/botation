### meme sender
 picks a random file from a user specified directory and sends it in chat
 if you use /send_meme you can choose what file type you want and optionally choose the exact file

 if you specify a channel id in config.͏py then the bot will send a random meme every 30 minutes

### christtt referencer
if you mention the name of a piece of [christtt's discography](https://christtt.bandcamp.com/) then there will be a 1/6 chance the bot will shout you out for it
